# web_page_ui_visualization
Using a web page UI to project raw systems data with Streamlit
In modern IT environments, efficient monitoring of distributed systems is critical for maintaining uptime and security. This project addresses the challenge by developing a Python and Flask-based framework that automates monitoring unique test cases across each managed system, collects comprehensive health data and stores results in a centralized network location. A responsive web dashboard provides intuitive visualization (user interface) through histograms and flowcharts, with advanced filtering for targeted analytics and reducing manual intervention and enhancing system reliability. Empirical results demonstrate significant reductions in monitoring workload and improvements in issue resolution times. This project not only delivers immediate operational benefits but also establishes a scalable template for automated systems management in similar enterprise contexts. Simple UI will make SSD testing and issue resolutions. This UI will help to dump the failure message of each system.
